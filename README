You will need a working installation of python-fuse and Voldemort, both
where Python can find and load them as "fuse" and "voldemort"
respectively.  Alternatively, you can define the environment variable
VOLDFS_DB to any other module that can be loaded and uses the same
interface as Voldemort; see fake.py for a simple example that's useful
for debugging and development.  To start, just do something like this:

	./voldfs.py -s /tmp/myfs

Yes, the -s is necessary, because something "down below" isn't thread-safe.
